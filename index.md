# Shopio Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 28.01.2026
**Version:** 1.0.0

Aurora Soft AI ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Shopio mobile application ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.

## 1) We Do Not Collect User-Identifying Data Directly
Shopio does **not** require accounts or collect names, emails, or other personal identifiers.

## 2) Cloud Storage & Sync
Your shopping lists are stored and synced in the cloud (Firebase) to enable backup and sharing. While we do not associate lists with a personal identity, the data is stored on our backend so it can sync across devices or shared lists.

## 3) Third-Party Services
The App uses third-party services that may collect **device-level** or **usage** data for their own processing:

- Google Mobile Ads (ads delivery and measurement)
- Analytics provider(s) (usage and performance)
- Google Play and RevenueCat (subscriptions and purchase validation)

These services may collect data such as device identifiers, app usage events, and diagnostic data. This data is not linked by us to your identity.

## 4) Shopping List Content
The App is intended only for **generic shopping list items**. You **must not** store sensitive, confidential, or personally identifying information in your lists (including addresses, phone numbers, financial data, health data, or government IDs). If you do, you do so **at your own risk**.

## 5) How We Use Information
We use data only to:
- Provide and operate the App
- Sync and back up shopping lists
- Improve app performance and features
- Show ads and measure ad performance
- Process subscriptions (ad removal)

## 6) Legal Basis (GDPR/EEA/UK)
If you are in the EEA/UK, we process data under the following bases:
- **Consent:** for personalized ads and analytics (where required).
- **Contract:** to provide subscription features and sync services.
- **Legitimate interests:** to maintain and improve the App (non-personalized analytics/diagnostics).

You can withdraw consent at any time via your device settings or ad preferences.

## 7) Your Rights (GDPR/EEA/UK)
You may have the right to:
- Access your data
- Correct or delete your data
- Restrict or object to processing
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent at any time
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority

Because we do not maintain user accounts, we may not be able to locate data without device identifiers (such as your advertising ID). You can reset your advertising ID in your device settings, which also resets ad-related data.

## 8) International Transfers
Third-party services may process data outside your country (including the U.S.). Appropriate safeguards may be used where required.

## 9) Data Retention
We retain data only as long as needed to operate the App and comply with legal obligations.

## 10) Security
We use reasonable security measures to protect data stored in the App and our backend. **No system is 100% secure**, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 11) Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
